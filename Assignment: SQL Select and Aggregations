1.) Which destination in the flights database is the furthest distance away, based on information in the flights table.
Show the SQL query(s) that support your conclusion.

SELECT dest, distance FROM flights
GROUP BY distance DESC

2.) What are the different numbers of engines in the planes table? For each number of engines, which aircraft have
the most number of seats? Show the SQL statement(s) that support your result

SELECT engines, MAX(seats), model
FROM planes
GROUP BY engines

3.)Show the total number of flights.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM flights

4.)Show the total number of flights by airline (carrier).

SELECT COUNT(*), carrier
FROM flights
GROUP BY carrier

5.)Show all of the airlines, ordered by number of flights in descending order

SELECT COUNT(*), carrier
FROM flights
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC

6.)Show only the top 5 airlines, by number of flights, ordered by number of flights in descending order.

SELECT COUNT(*), carrier
FROM flights
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5

7.). Show only the top 5 airlines, by number of flights of distance 1,000 miles or greater, ordered by number of
flights in descending order.

SELECT COUNT(*), carrier
FROM flights
WHERE distance >= 1000
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 5

8.)Create a question that (a) uses data from the flights database, and (b) requires aggregation to answer it, and
write down both the question, and the query that answers the question

What was the total amount of flights each carrier had on 12-25-2013?  Group by total flights desc.

SELECT COUNT(*), carrier
FROM flights
WHERE month = 12 and day = 25 and year = 2013
GROUP BY carrier
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
